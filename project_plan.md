### Intermediate Project Goals

#### Data Ingestion and Storage
- Complete the parsing of markdown files.
- Store embeddings in PostgreSQL using pgvector.
- Include file names/paths in the database for easy retrieval.

#### Basic Query Functionality
- Implement natural language query capabilities.
- Retrieve the most similar embeddings and corresponding file content.

#### Chunking and Embedding
- Apply text chunking for large markdown files.
- Generate embeddings for smaller text segments to enhance context and precision.

#### Query Enrichment and Answer Generation
- Create a function to enhance queries with retrieved content.
- Use an AI model (e.g., OpenAI) to generate answers.

#### User Interface (Optional)
- Develop a command-line or basic GUI interface for interaction.
- Allow inputting queries and viewing results.

Achieving these will result in a functional prototype showcasing your Local RAG system's core features. This prototype will serve as a basis for sharing results and gathering feedback, aligning with your gradual shift towards open-source solutions and initial use of cloud APIs.
